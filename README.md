## Images

The website uses a combination of real and placeholder images:

- **Screenshots**: 2 CSS-generated gradient placeholders with different colors
- **Hero image**: CSS gradient placeholder for main screenshot
- **No separate image files needed** - all handled via CSS

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in any web browser
2. All styling is self-contained in `style.css`
3. Download links point to actual installer and publish folders
4. Replace placeholder images with real screenshots when available

## Customization

To add real screenshots:
1. Replace the `.gallery-image` CSS classes with `<img>` tags
2. Add actual screenshot files to a new `images/` folder
3. Update the screenshot references in `index.html`

The design closely mimics WinRAR's classic, professional appearance while being modern and responsive.
